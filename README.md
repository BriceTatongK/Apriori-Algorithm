# Apriori Algorithm with SQL: Implementation and Testing on a Smart Home Relational Database
Objective
Implement the Apriori algorithm using SQL to discover frequent itemsets and generate association rules. This approach is tested through simulation on a smart home relational database, where transactional data is collected from various IoT devices (e.g., lights, thermostats, smart plugs).
